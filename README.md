Titanium.Network.HTTPClient with less suck!

This is a [titaniumified][ti] version of [superagent][sa]. This is built using [`grunt-titaniumifier`][gti].

### Installation

If you are developing a Titanium SDK application, a packaged *CommonJS* module can be found in the [Releases page][rls].

If you are instead
- porting with *titaniumifier* a Node.js module to Titanium, and it uses *superagent*;
- or building CommonJS module using *titaniumifier* and you want to have a reliable, stable, tested HTTPClient;

then you can install this module with

    npm install --save superagent ti-superagent

In your `package.json` add

```js
{
  "name": "...",
  "version": "...",
  // ...
  "titanium": {
    "superagent": "ti-superagent"
  }
}
```

This will tell *titaniumifier* that when your code requires `superagent`, `ti-superagent` is served instead.

You can use [this *package.json* from one of our modules][lrc-pkg] as a reference.

Usage overview
--------------

For the full documentation head over the [original repository][sa].

```js
var request = require('superagent');

request.get('http://my-awesome-server.it/api.txt')
.end(function (res) {
  console.log('Textual version of APIs:');
  console.log(res.text);
});

// The server will respond with: '{ "methods": [ "read", "update" ] }'

request.get('http://my-awesome-server.it/api.json')
.end(function (res) {
  console.log('JSON version of APIs:');
  res.body.methods.forEach(function (method) {
  	console.log('Iâ€™ll be able to call ' + method);
  });
});
```
