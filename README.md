ti-superagent
=============

Titanium.Network.HTTPClient with less suck!

This is a [titaniumified][ti] version of [superagent][sa]. This is built using [`grunt-titaniumifier`][gti].

[gti]: https://github.com/smclab/grunt-titaniumifier

```js
var request = require('ti-superagent');

request.get('http://my-awesome-server.it/api.txt')
.end(function (res) {
  console.log('Textual version of APIs:');
  console.log(res.text);
});

// The server will respond with: '{ "methods": [ "read", "update" ] }'

request.get('http://my-awesome-server.it/api.json')
.end(function (res) {
  console.log('JSON version of APIs:');
  res.body.methods.forEach(function (method) {
  	console.log('Iâ€™ll be able to call ' + method);
  });
});
```
